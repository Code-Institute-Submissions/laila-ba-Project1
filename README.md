# Milestone Project1 - 3D Artist Portfolio

## Introduction-

Welcome to my first milestone project: Adam Bahmani's 3D Art Portfolio. Throughout this project, i have been able to implememnt my learning and understanding of the modules and languages that i have been learning, and advnace in my front-end skills. Within this project, i have been able to showcase my design and development skills which have resulted in a functional website, built with HTML and CSS. 

Within this README, i will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where i gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You are able to view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/Project1/}

## UX- User Experience Design

One of my key main focuses while planning this project was The Elements of User-Experience. I found this approach extremely useful as it allowed me to keep the user's needs and feelings the main priority throughout the development of the project. This also helped the project result in a positive user experience. 

The Elements of User-Experience are broken into five different stages :

-The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane
