# Milestone Project1 - 3D Artist Portfolio

## Introduction-

Welcome to my first milestone project: Adam Bahmani's 3D Art Portfolio. Throughout this project, i have been able to implememnt my learning and understanding of the modules and languages that i have been learning, and advnace in my front-end skills. Within this project, i have been able to showcase my design and development skills which have resulted in a functional website, built with HTML and CSS. 

Within this README, i will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where i gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You are able to view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/Project1/)

## UX- User Experience Design

One of my key main focuses while planning this project was The Elements of User-Experience. I found this approach extremely useful as it allowed me to keep the user's needs and feelings the main priority throughout the development of the project. This also helped the project result in a positive user experience. 

The Elements of User-Experience are broken into five different stages :

-The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## Strategy Plane

As a creator and developer, i established that the goal of my project is to draw attention to Adam's 3D art, persuading employers to contact him for hire. Therefore, i came up with a list of goals that i would want to achieve for my project:

**Creator stories**

- As a creator, I want to create a positive user response throughout the project, allowing the user to find exactly what they are looking for.
- As a creator, i want to make sure that the project has easy navigation for the user.
- As a creator, i want to ensure that once viewing my project from the homepage, the user is not confused by the purpose of the project.
- As a creator, I want to make sure that all content isnt too much for the eye and it all flows together nicely and smoothly.
- As a creator, i want the projects design structure to be simple with an evident colour scheme.

After doing this, i went ahead and began to establish a startegy for what i would like my users to be feeling/thinking.

**User Stories**
 
 Goals for first-time users:
 
 - As a first-time user, i want to be able to easily navigate my way around the project.
 - As a first-time user, i want the content to be relevent to 3D art.
 - As a first-time user, I want to easily access the images of the art.
 - As a first-time user, i wnat to have a positive response.
 - As a first-time user, I want to feel as though i am progressing through the project and not feeling overwhelmed with the amount of content.
 
 Goals for returning users:
 
- As a returning user, I want to easily access the artists social media accounts on every sub-page.
- As a returning user, I want to simply be able to contact the artist through the contact form.

After looking at things from the user's perspective, i felt better prepared for developing the project as i had a better and clear understanding of what my project needed in order to satisfy the user.

## Scope Plane

Based off of the strategy plane and establishing the users needs, The scope plane tranforms strategy into requirements. This allowed me to plan out exactly what features my site needs to include. I decided that starting from the foundation and workig my way up to the more complex features would be the easiest and most useful approach. Also, breaking the requirments down into stages would allow me to focus on the basics first and not overwhelm myself.

**Stage 1:**

- A home page with a main hero image and minimal text.
- A resume page with a summary of skills and experience.
- A protfolio page showcasing pieces of art.
- A contact page with a conatct form.

**Stage 2:**

- Expansion on content within contact page. Adding an animated skills bar.
- Adding indicidual sub pages for every piece of art work.
- adding nav bar and footers on all pages.

**Stage 3:**

- Making the project responsive
- Adding interactive elements once i learn javascript


## Structure Plane

The strcuture plane gives shape to the scope and allows me to plan out how all the features fit toegther and behave. While doing this, researching and looking into the culture of 3D art porfolios enabled me to find out how to keep the users contantly interested . I knew from the beggining that my project was going to be very rich in images more than text as that users are more interested in the pieces of art alongisde minimal text. Sources of inspiration to deeper understand the culture of 3d art came from [Husni Qamhiyeh's Portfolio.](https://husni3d.com/)

After understanding more of the culture, i had established many features that the users would be expecting
