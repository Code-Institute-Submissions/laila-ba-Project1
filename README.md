# Milestone Project1 - 3D Artist Portfolio

## Introduction-

Welcome to my first milestone project: Adam Bahmani's 3D Art Portfolio. Throughout this project, i have been able to implememnt my learning and understanding of the modules and languages that i have been learning, and advnace in my front-end skills. Within this project, i have been able to showcase my design and development skills which have resulted in a functional website, built with HTML and CSS. 

Within this README, i will cover all the steps and planning processes used while creating this project, including where i gained my inspiration from and my main focuses as the developer. You are able to view my live project [here](https://laila-ba.github.io/Project1/)

## UX- User Experience Design

One of my key main focuses while planning this project was The Elements of User-Experience. I found this approach extremely useful as it allowed me to keep the user's needs and feelings the main priority throughout the development of the project. This also helped the project result in a positive user experience. 

The Elements of User-Experience are broken into five different stages :

- The Strategy Plane
- The Scope Plane
- The Structure Plane
- The Skeleton Plane
- The Surface Plane

## Strategy Plane

As a creator and developer, i established that the goal of my project is to draw attention to Adam's 3D art, persuading employers to contact him for hire. Therefore, i came up with a list of goals that i would want to achieve for my project:

**Creator stories**

- As a creator, I want to create a positive user response throughout the project, allowing the user to find exactly what they are looking for.
- As a creator, i want to make sure that the project has easy navigation for the user.
- As a creator, i want to ensure that once viewing my project from the homepage, the user is not confused by the purpose of the project.
- As a creator, I want to make sure that all content isnt too much for the eye and it all flows together nicely and smoothly.
- As a creator, i want the projects design structure to be simple with an evident colour scheme.

After doing this, i went ahead and began to establish a startegy for what i would like my users to be feeling/thinking.

**User Stories**
 
 Goals for first-time users:
 
 - As a first-time user, i want to be able to easily navigate my way around the project.
 - As a first-time user, i want the content to be relevent to 3D art.
 - As a first-time user, I want to immdeidtely understand the purpose of the project
 - As a first-time user, i want to have a positive response.
 - As a first-time user, I want to feel as though i am progressing through the project and not feeling overwhelmed with the amount of content.
 
 Goals for returning users:
 
- As a returning user, I want to easily access the artists social media accounts on every sub-page.
- As a returning user, I want to simply be able to contact the artist through the contact form.

After looking at things from the user's perspective, i felt better prepared for developing the project as i had a better and clear understanding of what my project needed in order to satisfy the user.

## Scope Plane

Based off of the strategy plane and establishing the users needs, The scope plane tranforms strategy into requirements. This allowed me to plan out exactly what features my site needs to include. I decided that starting from the foundation and workig my way up to the more complex features would be the easiest and most useful approach. Also, breaking the requirments down into stages would allow me to focus on the basics first and not overwhelm myself.

**Stage 1:**

- A home page with a main hero image and minimal text.
- A resume page with a summary of skills and experience.
- A protfolio page showcasing pieces of art.
- A contact page with a conatct form.

**Stage 2:**

- Expansion on content within contact page. Adding an animated skills bar.
- Adding indicidual sub pages for every piece of art work.
- adding nav bar and footers on all pages.

**Stage 3:**

- Making the project responsive
- Adding interactive elements once i learn javascript


## Structure Plane

The strcuture plane gives shape to the scope and allows me to plan out how all the features fit toegther and behave. While doing this, researching and looking into the culture of 3D art porfolios enabled me to find out how to keep the users contantly interested . I knew from the beggining that my project was going to be very rich in images more than text as that users are more interested in the pieces of art alongisde minimal text. Sources of inspiration to deeper understand the culture of 3d art came from [Husni Qamhiyeh's Portfolio.](https://husni3d.com/) After understanding more of the culture, i had established many features that the users would be expecting such as the colour scheme.

**Colours:**

- Dark grey
- White
- Blue

The constant use of a dark background makes it more relaxing and easier to read for the users. This also blends in with the dark background colour that all the 3D pieces have.

**Typography:**

- Oswald
- Lato

I chose to use two different fonts throughout the project to make it appear less repetitive and boring. Both the fonts used are minimalistic and easy to read, offering the focus to go to the images.

The navigation and footer are consistent throughout all sub-pages making it easy for the user to naviagte their way around the project. The navigation bar is fixed, making it always present no matter how far down the user scrolls. The elements inside the nav bar have a simple hover effect for the user to see interaction occuring.

Consistent use of imagery is used throughout the project to showcase the artists work and making it evident that the artist is creative. All the images should be relatable to the content on the page and not feel forced or out of place.

The typography is consistent across all pages as all text and content is centered, giving the site a clean finish.

The project will be responsive across all devices, keeping text at a readable size and images not pixelated.

## Skelaton Plane

As part of my planning process, creating wireframes and mockups helped me to visualise my ideas and see if they would be pleasing to the eye. These are my initial conceptual ideas:

**Wireframes:**

![home page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/110000633-7078a880-7d0b-11eb-8e68-28d93d0fb559.png)
![skills page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/110000656-753d5c80-7d0b-11eb-9256-22c3f80dd24f.png)
![portfolio page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/110000670-78384d00-7d0b-11eb-8a65-c77dc045beb0.png)
![contact page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/110000682-7b333d80-7d0b-11eb-9e02-4742417143ca.png)

**Mockups:**

![resume](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/110000762-9140fe00-7d0b-11eb-97be-f5abccf68f2e.png)

Here are the differences between the initial wireframes and mockups to m current project:

- Nav bar is no longer a side bar and is instead at the top of the page.
- I have added a logo at the top of the page.
- I have changed the image slideshow on the landing page to a moving GIF
- I have added minimal text on the landing page and a link to the resume page.
- The footer is at the bottom of the page and is now blue.
- On the contact page, all content is in the center of the page.
- There is an animated skills bar in the resume page.
- i added a 'get in touch' button on the reume page that links to the contact form.

I chose to go ahead with these changes as i thought it would make my project a lot more appealing to the user. The changes were made as a result of my growth and learning in front-end developement as i have more of an understanding and more experience in the design and development of the project.

## Surface Plane

**Features that are present across the project:**

- The navigation bar is responsive and can be viewed on all devices as it toggles to a hamburger menu when viewed on smaller viewports. The colour black allows the content of the navbar to appear easily. The active pages have a background of grey while the others have no background. On the far left, there is a logo with white writing and a blue border.

- Theres are clear house colours being used throughout the project: blue, grey, white and a little black. This makes everything flow together and no sudden bright colours are used, making the user know what to expect from the website.

- The GIF on the landing page has a dark background which is consistent with all the images across the project. The dark backgrounds help the 3D objects within the image appear more vibrant and attract the users attention.

- A dark backround is used on all pages to create a clear contrast with the text. This makes the text more easier to read and doesnt make the user tired to look at the pages. The user should look at the content as flowing and simple to look at.

- The footer is very simple and minimalistic with no background as the social icons are in the home colour blue.

- The use of two different fonts, Oswald and Lato, makes the project look less repetitive in its text. The contrast is used for the headings and normal text.

**Features that i still need to add:**

- Having the contact form send the users message to the artists email.
- Once learning Javascript, i would like to add iteractive features.
- Having the high quality pictures load fast.
- Adding a light/dark toggle mode for the user to choose whichever option they prefer.
- When the user hovers over the art images in the portfolio, a moving GIF will appear of that specific 3D piece.

## Testing

**Testing User stories from User Experience Design (UX) Section**

* **As a first-time user, i want to be able to easily navigate my way around the project.**
  * Users are able to use the navigation bar located at the top of the page to navigate their way around the project. The nav bar is fixed and therefore always present no matter 
how far down the user scrolls.

![nav bar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75024926/110127105-1cc69780-7dbd-11eb-8e5b-6bd90ab6537a.png)

* **As a first-time user, I want to immdeidtely understand the purpose of the project**
  * A users reach the landing page, they see a large moving GIF of 3D art, besides this, there is visable text greeting the user saying "welcome to my portfolio" "3D artist| London" This allows the user to immediately understand that this project is a portfolio for a 3D artist that is located in london.

## Known bugs and fixes

* The footer on the landing page wouldnt stay at the bottome of the page.
  * I added a filler div before the footer to push it down.

* The image on the resume page wasnt centered and drifted to the left when viewed on smaller screens 
  * i added margin: 0 127px to ensure that it would be centered.

* The animated skills bar didnt appear to be responsive on mobile devices as it was too small.
  * adjusted the media query for the skills bar to @media max-width: 400px and gave it width of 90% so that it is more apparent and readable to the user. 
  
* W3C Markup Validator flagged up some errors that consisted of multiple </div> tags without an opening div.
  * I made sure to fix this error removing all empty divs that were not being used.

* There was an issue with the social icons in the footer not being seen when the hamburger nav bar is chosen.
  * I fixed this by adding a z-index:10 so that the icons can be selected aswell as the hamburger menu is opened on a smaller device. My mentor helped me correct this issue and explained to me the purpose of a "z-inex".
